        <p>
          The Chartreux is a rare breed of cat from France, and is recognised by
          a number of registries around the world. The Chartreux is large and
          muscular (called cobby) with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and
          very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (silver-grey)
          water-resistant short hair double coats which are often slightly thick
          in texture (often showing "breaks" like a sheepskin) and orange- or
          copper-coloured eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their "smile"
          due to the structure of their heads and their tapered muzzles, they
          often appear to be smiling. Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are
          highly prized by farmers.

        <p>
          There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from cats brought
          to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order's head monastery,
          the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of
          the city of Grenoble. But in 1972, the Prior of the Grande Chartreuse
          denied that the monastery's archives held any records of the monks'
          use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux. Legend also has it
          that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is
          now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in the 13th
          century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order.
